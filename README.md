# rollout-redis ⛳️

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rollout-redis.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/rollout-redis)

Fast and easy feature flags based on Redis. 

Based on the discontinued [rollout](https://github.com/fetlife/rollout) project, removing some capabilities, including some new features and supporting latest Redis versions.

## Install it 

```bash
gem install rollout-redis
```

## Quick Start 💨

Instantiate the `Rollout` class sending a `Redis` instance as a parameter.

```ruby
require 'redis'
require 'rollout'

@redis ||= Redis.new(
        host: ENV.fetch('REDIS_HOST'),
        port: ENV.fetch('REDIS_PORT')
      )
@rollout ||= Rollout.new(@redis)
```

Now you can activate Feature Flags:

```ruby
@rollout.activate('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME') # => true/false
```

Verify if a feature is currently enabled:

```ruby
if @rollout.active?('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME')
  # your new code here...
end
```

An alternative to the if check, is to wrap your code under the `with_feature` method. The wrapped code will be performed only if the feature flag is active:

```ruby
@rollout.with_feature('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME') do
  # your new code here...
end
```

If there is an issue, you have the option to disable a feature:

```ruby
@rollout.deactivate('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME')
```

If you want to list all the stored feature flags, you can use the `features` method:

```ruby
@rollout.features
```

The response will be an array of hashes with all the information about the stored feature flags

```ruby
[
  { name: 'a-feature-flag', percentage: 100, data: { requests: 50, errors: 1 } },
  { name: 'another-feature-flag', percentage: 20, data: { requests: 1, errors: 0 } },
  { name: 'super-feature-flag', percentage: 50, data: { requests: 828, errors: 34 } }
]
```

## Advanced features 🦾

### Gradual activation based on percentages

When introducing a new feature, it's a recommended practice to gradually enable it for a specific portion of your target audience to evaluate its impact. To achieve this, you can utilize the `activate` method, as shown below:

```ruby
@rollout.activate('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', 20)
```

Now, to know if a feature flags is enabled, you need to provide a determinator (in this example, we're using the user email):

```ruby
if @rollout.active?('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', user_email)
  # your new code here...
end
```

The gradual activation also works wrapping your code within the `with_feature` method, you just need to provde the determinator you want to use.

```ruby
@rollout.with_feature('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', user_email) do
  # your new code here...
end
```

It's important to note that if you use the `active?` method without specifying a determinator to determine whether this subset of the audience should see the new feature, it will always return `false` since the activation percentage is less than 100%. See:

```ruby
@rollout.activate('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME', 20)
@rollout.active?('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME') # => false
```

### Caching Feature Flags

The Rollout gem is tightly integrated with Redis for feature flag status management. Consequently, occasional connectivity issues between your application and the Redis storage may arise.

To prevent potential application degradation when the Redis storage is unavailable, you can enable feature flag status caching during the gem's instantiation:

```ruby
@rollout ||= Rollout.new(redis).with_cache
```

Additionally, you can specify extra parameters to configure the duration (in seconds) for which the feature flag status is stored in the cache. By default, this duration is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes):

```ruby
@rollout ||= Rollout.new(redis)
              .with_cache(expires_in: 300)
```

In the case that you need to clear the cache at any point, you can make use of the `clean_cache` method:

```ruby
@rollout.clean_cache
```

### Auto-deactivating flags

If you want to allow the gem to deactivate your feature flag automatically when a threshold of erros is reached, you can enable the degrade feature using the `with_degrade` method.

```ruby
@rollout ||= Rollout.new(redis)
              .with_cache
              .with_degrade(min: 100, threshold: 0.1)
```

So now, instead of using the `active?` method, you need to wrap your new code under the `with_feature` method.

```ruby
@rollout.with_feature('FEATURE_FLAG_NAME') do
  # your new feature code here...
end
```

When any unexpected error appears during the wrapped code execution, the Rollout gem will take it into account for automatically deactivating the feature flag if the threshold of errors is reached. All the managed or captured errors inside the wrapped code will not be taken into consideration.

## Rake tasks

In order to have access to the rollout rakes, you have to load manually the task definitions. For doing so load the rollout rake task:

```ruby
require 'rollout'

load 'rollout/tasks/rollout.rake'
```

Also, for using the rake tasks, you must set the following env variables

```shell
ROLLOUT_REDIS_HOST=localhost
ROLLOUT_REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Usage

To activate/deactivate features, execute the following rake tasks:

```shell
bundle exec rake rollout:on[feature_name]
bundle exec rake rollout:off[feature_name]
```

To a gradual activation based on percentages, pass the percentage as the second parameter when executing the `on` task.

```shell
bundle exec rake rollout:on[feature_name,50]
```

_NOTE_: In both cases, `feature_name` **must not** include quotes e.g. `bundle exec rake rollout:on['feature_name']`, as the gem will be unable to fetch its activation status if so.

For listing all the stored feature flags, do:

```shell
bundle exec rake rollout:list
```

## Migrating from rollout gem 🚨
